# Sorting Algorithm Efficiency Experiment

This repository contains a Java program designed to test the efficiency of three sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort with a pass per item, Bubble Sort until no change, and Bubble Sort while needed. The experiment is conducted on various types of arrays, including random, sorted, partially sorted, reverse sorted, arrays with duplicates, arrays without duplicates, and arrays with equal elements.

## Experiment Overview

The experiment aims to analyze the performance of the mentioned sorting algorithms across different types of arrays and compare their execution times. The array types and sizes are systematically varied to provide a comprehensive understanding of algorithm behavior.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Java installed on your machine.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

3. Compile the Java file using the following command:

   ```bash
   javac ArrayGeneratorGeneral.java
